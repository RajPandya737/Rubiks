# Rubik's Cube Solver

## Description
This Python project aims to solve a Rubik's Cube using computer vision techniques and matrix operations. Please note that this project is currently under development.

The project utilizes the following libraries:
- OpenCV: Used for image processing and capturing images of each side of the Rubik's Cube.
- NumPy: Utilized to simulate the Rubik's Cube as multidimensional arrays and perform matrix operations.
- Pillow: Used for image manipulation and processing.
- ColorMath: Utilized for color analysis and detection.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

1. `main.py`: The main Python script.
2. `cube.py`: The file containing the Rubiks cube class and the Cubie class.
3. `config.py`:File containing all constants used in the program.
4. `color_diff.py`: A file containing color math operations.
5. `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.


## Future Development
As mentioned earlier, this project is still in development. Here are some potential improvements that may be implemented in the future:

- Implement a more sophisticated image processing algorithm to improve cube detection and color recognition.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Optimize the code for better performance and efficiency.
